# `rns-mavlink`

> Reticulum-Mavlink bridge

Bridges a flight controller connectd via serial port to a ground station over Reticulum
mesh network.

## Building and running

Ground Control (`gc`) and Flight Conroller (`fc`) binaries require ports and forward
links to be specified as command-line arguments:

```
# ground control
cargo run --bin gc -- -p 4242 -f 127.0.0.1:4243
# flight controller
cargo run --bin fc -- -p 4243 -f 127.0.0.1:4242
```

Additional configuration such as serial device and ground control ports are set in
`Gc.toml` and `Fc.toml` config files.

The `gc` application runs on a system that can communicate with ground station software
(QGroundControl, MissionPlanner) via UDP (either locally or over internet).
Configuration is as follows:

- `gc_udp_address` -- UDP address:port where ground station application is reachable,
  example: `"127.0.0.1:14550"`
- `gc_reply_port` -- local UDP port where ground station will send replies, example:
  `9999`
- `fc_destination` -- Reticulum address hash of the fc node, example:
  `"db332f13541eb2e4b47d02923fbbcb9a"`

The `fc` application runs on a system that is connected to a flight controller via
USB/serial port. Configuration:

- `serial_port` -- serial port where the flight controller is connected, example:
  `"/dev/ttyACM0"`
- `serial_baud` -- serial port baud rate, example: `115200`
- `gc_destination` -- Reticulum address hash of the gc node, example:
  `"758727c1d044e1fd8a838dc8d1832e95"`

The provided `fc` and `gc` binaries initialize UDP interfaces for next-hop communication
over Reticulum. The `rns_mavlink` library can be used with other Reticulum
configurations by initializing your own `Transport` instance and passing as an argument
to the `Fc` and `Gc` structs when running.

## Kaonic build

Build the docker image from this repository
<https://github.com/BeechatNetworkSystemsLtd/kaonic-radio/blob/main/Dockerfile>:
```
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t kaonicradioimage .
```
In the Dockerfile there are lines commented-out to set up the Yocto SDK. You can try
un-commenting those lines to get the SDK installed in the image. If not you will have to
run those same commands inside the container.

Run the container:
```
docker run -dit --rm --net=host --platform linux/arm64 --name kaonicradiocontainer \
  kaonicradioimage bash
```

The container will remain running and you can enter the container with:
```
docker exec -ti kaonicradiocontainer bash
```

Clone this repository and checkout the `kaonic-build` branch:
```
git clone https://github.com/BeechatNetworkSystemsLtd/rns-mavlink-rs rns-mavlink
cd rns-mavlink
git checkout -t origin/kaonic-build
```
Run the `build.sh` script (modify to add `--release` flags if needed):
```
./build.sh
```
The output `fc` and `gc` binaries will be in
`target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/debug/` or
`target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release/` depending on the flags provided to the
build command.

### Kaonic installation

Copy the `fc` and `gc` binaries into `/home/root/fc/` and `/home/root/gc/` on the target
systems, together with `Fc.toml` and `Gc.toml` configuration files. On the flight
controller system, install the `rns-mavlnk-fc.service` file into `/etc/systemd/system/`
and run `systemctl daemon-reload` and `systemctl enable rns-mavlink-fc.service` to
enable start on boot. To start the service manually `systemctl start
rns-mavlink-fc.service`.
